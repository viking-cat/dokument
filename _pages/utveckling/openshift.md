# Deployments
$ oc new-app &#60;address&#62; --as-deployment-config               Launch deployment config, ex
                                                            oc new-app quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world --as-deployment-config

$ oc new-app &#60;address&#62; --name demo-app --as-deployment-config    Change label from "app=hello-world" to "app=demo-app"
                                                            Changing label allows for multiple deployments of same thing that can be created and deleted separately
    $ oc logs -f buildconfig/hello-world                    Follow the build process
$ oc get dc                                                 Get deployment configs
$ oc get istag                                              Get image stream tags
$ oc delete dc/hello-world                                  Remove the deployment config named hello-world

                                                            Recommended cleanup method
$ oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world                             See YAML for deployment config
$ oc rollout latest dc/hello-world                          Rollout new version of deployment config (upgrade)
$ oc rollback dc/hello-world                                Rollback one deployment config version backwards (downgrade)
