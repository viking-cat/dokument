For moments with lack of memory

# Bash
<pre>
# Searching
$ find . -iname &#60;query&#62;                         Look for files that fulfills "query" starting with current folder.
                                                        Query like "*item*" would return all files that contain the word item somewhere in the name.


Compressing Files
$ tar zxvf &#60;filename.tgz&#62;                       Will uncompress the filename.tgz file in the current folder.
